# Frontend Documentation Index

The frontend is a single-page React application (TypeScript, Vite) that manages pipeline runs, mapping edits, and developer tooling. Core references:

- [architecture.md](architecture.md) — application shell, state management, services, theming.
- [ui_flows.md](ui_flows.md) — screen-by-screen walkthrough (upload, mapping editor, developer console, results).
- [components.md](components.md) — reusable component inventory & key props.

Update this index when new docs are added.
