# Archive

This folder stores legacy documentation preserved for historical context. None of the files here reflect the current AntiCheatAI implementation on the `AntiCheat-v0.0` branch. Refer to the root files in `documentation/` for accurate guidance.

Contents:

- `legacy/documentation/` – Previous doc tree retained for reference.
- `legacy/root_docs/` – Historical analyses and plans tied to the stream rewrite project.

Do not update files in `archive/` unless you are explicitly curating history. All active documentation should live alongside the new markdown files in the parent directory.
