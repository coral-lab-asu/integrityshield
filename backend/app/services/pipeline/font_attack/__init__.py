"""
Utilities for building LaTeX font-based attacks.

The attack operates by assigning portions of the visual text to each hidden
character, then cloning a baseline TrueType font so that the glyph for every
hidden character renders the desired visual fragment. Each position receives
its own derivative font which LaTeX activates locally during PDF generation.
