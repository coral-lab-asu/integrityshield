\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*.}]
  \item Which gas is the most significant contributor to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect?
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item Methane (CH$_4$)
    \item Nitrous oxide (N$_2$O)
    \item Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$)
    \item Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
  \end{enumerate}

  \item The term ``carbon sink'' refers to:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item A source of carbon emissions
    \item A reservoir that absorbs more carbon than it releases
    \item A method of carbon taxation
    \item Industrial carbon capture facilities only
  \end{enumerate}

  \item Ocean acidification is primarily caused by:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item Increased water temperature
    \item Absorption of atmospheric CO$_2$
    \item Agricultural runoff
    \item Oil spills
  \end{enumerate}

  \item Which of the following is a positive feedback loop in climate change?
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item Increased cloud cover reflecting sunlight
    \item Melting ice reducing Earth's albedo
    \item Plants absorbing more CO$_2$ as levels rise
    \item Ocean absorption of heat
  \end{enumerate}

  \item The Paris Agreement aims to limit global temperature increase to:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item 1.0°C above pre-industrial levels
    \item 1.5°C to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels
    \item 3°C above pre-industrial levels
    \item Pre-industrial levels exactly
  \end{enumerate}

  \item The greenhouse effect is entirely harmful and did not exist before human industrialization. (True/False)

  \item Coral bleaching events are primarily caused by elevated ocean temperatures. (True/False)

  \item Deforestation contributes to climate change by reducing carbon sequestration capacity. (True/False)

  \item Explain the carbon cycle and how human activities have disrupted this natural process. Discuss at least three major anthropogenic sources of carbon emissions.

  \item Analyze the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Discuss specific examples of affected ecosystems and species, and evaluate potential conservation strategies.
