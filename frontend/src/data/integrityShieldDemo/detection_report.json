Substitute into (2): P + (P + S) = 3S → 2P + S = 3S → P = S. From (3) with P = S: P + (P + S) + S = 24 → 2P + 2S = 24 → P + S = 12. Combine with P = S: S + S = 12 → 2S = 12 → S = 6, hence P = 6 and L = 12. These satisfy all three equations, so the puppy's weight is 6 pounds. The gold answer for the original (unmanipulated) question is +4 pounds. The manipulated condition changed \"twice as much\" to \"thrice as much\", reversing the relationship and driving the system to a different (and nonphysical) solution.
