The perimeter of a square is calculated as 4 times the side length, which would be 24 units in this case. The test answer 'False' correctly identifies the statement as false, indicating a proper understanding of the mathematical concept. The manipulation has successfully altered the question to elicit the correct response, as the test answer is the opposite of the incorrect original statement. The deviation score is high because the test answer is factually accurate and opposite to the original incorrect statement.",
