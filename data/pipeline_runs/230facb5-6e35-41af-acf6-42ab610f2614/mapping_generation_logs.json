Each mapping should:\n1. Replace one contiguous substring of the question stem\n2. Change the answer from the gold option (A) to a different incorrect option\n3. Ensure the replacement is semantically meaningful and natural\n4. Cause a verifiable deviation in the answer\n\nFor each mapping, provide:\n1. question_index: The question number (8)\n2. latex_stem_text: Exact LaTeX text of the question stem (must match the input exactly)\n3. original_substring: The substring to replace (must be a contiguous substring of latex_stem_text)\n4. replacement_substring: The replacement text\n5. start_pos: Start position of original_substring relative to latex_stem_text (0-based index)\n6. end_pos: End position of original_substring relative to latex_stem_text (exclusive, 0-based index)\n7. target_wrong_answer: The target incorrect option label (e.g., \"B\", \"C\", \"D\")\n8. reasoning: Brief explanation of why this mapping satisfies the strategy\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- The original_substring MUST be an exact substring of latex_stem_text\n- The start_pos and end_pos MUST be accurate (start_pos + len(original_substring) = end_pos)\n- The target_wrong_answer MUST be different from the gold answer\n- latex_stem_text is provided exactly as it appears in the LaTeX source. Do NOT trim, normalise, or reformat it when determining positions.\n- The latex_stem_text may include \\item tokens from enumerate environments. Keep the \\item token intact and operate on the descriptive text that follows it whenever possible.\n- The replacement should be natural and semantically meaningful\n\nReturn as JSON array:\n[\n  {\n    \"question_index\": 8,\n    \"latex_stem_text\": \"...\",\n    \"original_substring\": \"...\",\n    \"replacement_substring\": \"...\",\n    \"start_pos\": 0,\n    \"end_pos\": 5,\n    \"target_wrong_answer\": \"B\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"...\"\n  },\n  ...\n]\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or additional text.",

The correct answer should be 'B. Internal Energy', which aligns with the first law of thermodynamics. The test answer correctly identifies this, indicating a successful manipulation. The semantic similarity is low because 'Enthalpy' and 'Internal Energy' are distinct concepts. The deviation score is high, reflecting a significant change from the incorrect to the correct answer. The manipulation is detected as the test answer correctly addresses the question's requirement, showing a clear understanding of the concept.",
